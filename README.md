# EcohNet
### (06/13/24) We are currently testing the updated version. To use this version, unzip the folder and download "ecohnet0x.wl" to the same folder. Then, in the notebook file, specify Needs["ecohnet0x`"] instead of Needs["ecohnet0`"].
  
This is the source code for [Suzuki et al. (2022), “Decomposing predictability to identify dominant causal drivers in complex ecosystems”](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.14.484197v1.full). To set up an environment to analyze your own data, follow steps below (assuming Mathematica is installed):

1.	Download and unzip ecohnet.zip
2.	Open ecohnet_main.nb
3.	Edit ”xxx” in “SetDirectory["xxx"]” to change it to the path of the unzipped folder
4.	Execute each cell according to the instructions in the nb file

If you want to reproduce the results of the paper, download [data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhmhZqMog9IP2t3TkH-zjQHC33PNYcoY/view?usp=sharing) and unzip it in the ecohnet folder.
